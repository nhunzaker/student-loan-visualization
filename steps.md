# Data

- [Student loan data](http://studentaid.ed.gov/about/data-center/student/title-iv)
- [Census data for geo-locations of zip codes](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2013.html)

# Instructions

1. Normalize to commas using libreoffice


# Odd notes

1. (data.gov)[http://www.data.gov/] is freaking amazing
2. For some reason `INTPTLONG` in the CSV data has a bunch of spaces after it. I had to manually remove that. Not sure when that occured, or if it came that way
